title: Timing Mechanisms
description: The protocol has different timing requirements for various operations.

### Vault Operations (Instant)

- Staking into the vault is instant, but doesn't earn yield for the entry epoch
- Unstaking from the vault is instant, but doesn't earn yield for the exit epoch
- If you stake and unstake in the same epoch, you can use `instantUnstake()` to immediately withdraw

### Unwrapping Operations (Delayed)

- Unwrapping the Stream wrapped token back to the underlying token is a two-step process:
  1. First, initiate the withdrawal
  2. Complete the withdrawal after one epoch (24 hours) has passed
- Important: If you initiate multiple withdrawals across different times, you must wait for the latest epoch to complete before withdrawing any funds. For example:
  - If you initiate a withdrawal in epoch 1
  - Then initiate another withdrawal in epoch 2 (without completing the first withdrawal)
  - All funds (from both withdrawals) will only be available after epoch 2 completes

This design allows for efficient vault operations while maintaining secure underlying token management.
