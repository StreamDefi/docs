Stream V2 constructs yield bearing vaults. There are two core pieces of infrasturcture:

- The first is a simple wrapper contract which wraps the underlying token of the vault (i.e USDC for the StreamUSDC vault)
- The second is the vault contract which allows users to stake this wrapped token and earn their proportional yield from the Stream's farmed yield. This is represented through a share token.

Both the wrapped version of the token and the share token are both natively bridgeable through LayerZero
