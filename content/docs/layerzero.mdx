title: LayerZero Integration
---

Both the wrapped tokens and vault share tokens implement LayerZero V2's OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) standard. This enables native token bridging across all LayerZero-supported chains, allowing users to seamlessly move their positions between different networks while maintaining their yield-earning capabilities.

The structure is similar [Ethena's USDe and sUSDe](https://docs.ethena.fi/) structure, however the yield is not generated from a carry trade - yet remains delta neutral.
