Upon wrapping the token, the funds will be held in the `StableWrapper` contract where they are free to be withdrawn from the vault owner. The vault owner manages funds in a multisig which is used to farm different yield opportunities (managing it through the contract reduces flexibility on the yield opportunities). The vault owner's wallet will be public and it's positions will be easily monitored through a transparency dashboard we are currently working on.
