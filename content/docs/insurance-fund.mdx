title: Insurance Fund
---

Profits Stream takes are used to fund an insurance fund for users. This helps mitigate the risk of depegs in the future due to smart contract risks or minor drawdowns.

We are in the process of separating our wallets based on strategies (ie exposure to USD, BTC, or ETH), and as a part of this process will be separating the insurance wallet as well. When this is done, which should be over the course of the next week, we will share it here.

We will also be sharing a more in depth explanation of how Stream takes fees and methodology.
