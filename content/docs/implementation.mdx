title: Implementation
---

The token wrapper contract is called `StableWrapper`. Upon wrapping the token, the underlying deposited token will be used for yield farming while the user receives a 1-to-1 wrapped version of this token. The user will not be entitled to any yield unless they stake in the vault contract. To unwrap this token, there will be a 1 day delay in order to allow time for the vault keeper to deposit the underlying token back into the contract to allow for withdrawals to complete.

<Card>
  At the start all tokens will be required to be autostaked so all users will be
  entitled to yield. This is handled through the `allowIndependence` flag on the
  `StableWrapper` contract and may change in the future which will allow the
  user to hold the wrapped token in itself.
</Card>

Upon staking the wrapped token (defined in the `StreamVault` contract), the user will receive shares representing their stake in the vault. These shares are non-rebasing tokens, meaning their quantity remains constant while the underlying value they represent may change based on accumulated yield.
